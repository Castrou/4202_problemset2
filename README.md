## Part A:
Run with the following command:  
_python parta.py --imageset {imageset}_

Replace {imageset} with either "One" or "Two", depending on the image set you'd like to you (ie. "Calibration - One" or "Calibration - Two")

The intrinsic values resulting from calibration will be printed, and a topdown perspective of the imageset will be created in either "Top Down - One" or "Top Down - Two" depending on the imageset chosen
