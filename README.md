Installation:

# How to use:
Part A:
Run with the following command:
python parta.py --imageset "{imageset}"

Replace {imageset} with either One or Two, depending on the image set you'd like to you (ie. "Calibration - One" or "Calibration - Two")

The intrinsic values resulting from calibration will be printed, and a topdown perspective of the imageset will be created in either "Top Down - One" or "Top Down - Two" depending on the imageset chosen
